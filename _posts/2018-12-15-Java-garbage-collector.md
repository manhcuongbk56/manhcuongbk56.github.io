# Some notes about Java garbage collector
## It contains `Young generation`, `Old generation` or sometimes call `Tenured generation`.
1. Divide to these generation cause of `the weak generational hypothesis`.
+ `Young generation` : newly created object will not live long.
+ `Old generation`: after object created, if it survives after some garbage collecion it will be moved from
`young generation` to `old generation`

## Since it have some kinds of GC, we can make our choice to get a appropriate one.
+ `Serial collector`: run only on once core, pause time will be huge, for client style machine. It is default GC.
We can chose it by using `-XX:+UseSerialGC` command line option.
+ `Parallel collector`: utilize multi core of model PC. GC will run on multi core, reduce pause time.
Server machine should use it, use ` â€“XX:ParallelGCThreads=n` command line option with n is number of core.
