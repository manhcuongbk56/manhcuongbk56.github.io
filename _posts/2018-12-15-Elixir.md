# Today, i start to learn Elixir - an interesting language which focus on functional programming, concurrent processing...I'll find out more about this language later.

## I. Reading `Programming Elixir >= 1.6` book. Learn some low-level ingredients of Elixir. Note some remarkable below.
1. Elixir is functional programming. It means no mutable data. It's all about transforming data.
I think that it is one of things making Elixir become suitable for concurrent programming.
2. `=` is not assignment.
In Elixir, `=` operator is matching operator (patternt maching). 

Example:
```Elixir
 a = 2 
```
mean that Elixir will try to set `a` to value that can be equal to 2.
3. `with`
This is an example about how to use `with` in Elixir. I feel this is so weird.

Example:
```Elixir
content = "Now is the time"
lp = with {:ok, file} 		= File.open("/etc/passwd"),
			content 		= IO.read(file, :all), #note: same as above
			:ok				= File.close(file),
			[_, uid, gid] 	= Regex.run(~r/^lp:.*?:(\d+):(\d+)/m, content) 
		do
			"Group: #{gid}, User: #{uid}"
		end
IO.puts lp
IO.puts content
```
