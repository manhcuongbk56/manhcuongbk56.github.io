## Today, i start to learn Elixir - an interesting language which focus on functional programming, concurrent processing...I'll find out more about this language later.

## Reading `Programming Elixir >= 1.6` book. Learn some low-level ingredients of Elixir. Note some remarkable below.
1. Elixir is functional programming. It means no mutable data. It's all about transforming data.
I think that it will make Elixir become suitable for concurrent programming.
2. `=` is not assignment.
In Elixir, `=` operator is matching operator (patternt maching). 
Ex: a = 2 mean that Elixir will try to set `a` to value that can be equal to 2.
