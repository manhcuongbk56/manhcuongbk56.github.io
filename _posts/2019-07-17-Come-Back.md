# Narrative
So, after a long time abandon this job. To day, i come back.
I realize that i should keep this habit to mark everything i learn. 
So i can look back to know how much i tried and how much i learned.
From this day, no more lazy person inside me.
At the end of the day, i'll use 15-30 minutes to sum up what i've learned today.
 
# To Maise
You can access this page at the beginning of the day to know what i learned last day.
^ ^, it could be a big support for me. Thank you.
