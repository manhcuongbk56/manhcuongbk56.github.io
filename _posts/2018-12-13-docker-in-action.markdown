#Some thing about `Docker`
## Some basic comment. To get to familiar with docker.
+ `docker run` to run an image. If this image is not in local, docker will download and run it.
+ `docker ps` to list all running docker.
+ `docker restart name_of_docker` to restart a container that was stopped.
+ `docker logs name_of_docker` to check log, can add --follow to keep watching log.
+ `docker exec` to run additional process in running container.
