## I. Teaching SQL
Teaching some sql for my younger brother.
He just got an intern job. His work is some things like analys data...
So, he want to learn SQL to be active in selecting data from **BIG QUERY**.

## II. Rails

### Seperate controller
Folow Mr.Linh's recommend, i seperate controller to 2 pasts, one for html and one for json.
It helps me practicing Rails.

### Write Rspec test
First time, i write a test case in rspec by myself. Hmm, it doesn't feel right right now,
but i think, i just got to be familiar with Rspec, still, have a lot to learn, :((
